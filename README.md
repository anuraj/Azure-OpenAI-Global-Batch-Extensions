# Azure OpenAI Global Batch Extensions

The Azure OpenAI Batch API is designed to handle large-scale and high-volume processing tasks efficiently. Process asynchronous groups of requests with separate quota, with 24-hour target turnaround, at 50% less cost than global standard. With batch processing, rather than send one request at a time you send a large number of requests in a single file.â€¯Global batch requests have a separate enqueued token quota avoiding any disruption of your online workloads.

This is a C# wrapper on top of the REST endpoints.
